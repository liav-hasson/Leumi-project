about argo design choices i made

Why App-of-Apps? 
    I wanted to seperate all configurations from terraform and use Git as a source of truth.
    That way, i can dynamically configure environments and modify them easily using helm charts.
    Using app-of-apps, i can deploy a single resource to the cluster - the root application.

    The root application centralizes the bootstrap process: ArgoCD syncs the root app once, which then installs foundational components (ALB controller, External Secrets, Jenkins platform, quiz app) with ordered sync waves to avoid conflicts. 

Why not individual Applications or an ApplicationSet? 
    Managing each application separately is a valid strategy as long as the scale is low.
    When the application amout grows, using apps-of-apps is important to avoid manual creation/synchronization and dependency ordering issues. 
    ApplicationSets shine when you need many similar apps (clusters, tenants) generated from templates, which isn’t the case here. The footprint is a small, fixed collection of components, so a static apps-of-apps is simpler and more deterministic.


what type of secret resources do i use in argocd? for what and why?
    The platform deploys the External Secrets Operator via gitops/applications/external-secrets.yaml, then the quiz app chart turns on ExternalSecret manifests (gitops/quiz-app/values.yaml (lines 62-74)). These CRDs pull items like /devops-quiz/openai-api-key from AWS SSM Parameter Store into Kubernetes Secrets, keeping credentials off Git while letting ArgoCD reconcile them.
