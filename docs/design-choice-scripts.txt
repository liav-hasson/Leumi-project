* draft document

explaining the bash scripts structure i use for this project.
imprtand note! the scripts are buggy and unreliable. will be impoved over time.

- the purpose of the scripts is to provide utilities, and make the workflow easy.

- they are structured to be moveable, so they can run on any machine that pulls the source code. 
* they are dependent on the project architecture and relative paths.

- the main 3 scripts are:
    1. manage-project.sh        # starts and deletes the project
    2. monitor-deployment.sh    # a monitor and logger script
    3. project-utils.sh         # friendly management interface
    * go to "/home/liav/github/Leumi-project/quiz-app/iac/scripts"
for a demonstration.

- the scripts use helpers that source each other, for easier management.
