Critical Issues

quiz-app/iac/terraform/terraform.tfstate, quiz-app/iac/terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup, quiz-app/iac/terraform/.terraform/, and .terraform.tfstate.lock.info are committed. These files can leak state data (ARNs, secrets) and break team workflows. Clean state files must be removed from git history and .gitignore already covers them.
quiz-app/Jenkinsfile (line 70) calls ./scripts/compute_next_version.sh, but the repo only has src/scripts/compute_next_version.sh. The very first stage will fail with “No such file or directory”, so the pipeline never progresses.
quiz-app/Jenkinsfile (lines 93-110),  (line 98), and  (lines 135-139) reference a source_code/ tree plus tests/test_website.py and requirements.txt in the repo root. None of these paths exist (actual code sits under src/), so linting, pytest, Bandit, and Safety stages will consistently fail.
quiz-app/src/scripts/update-gitops.sh (line 33) sparse-checkouts a weather-deployment directory that is not present in the ArgoCD repo. The GitOps update stage will error out after cloning, preventing deployment.
quiz-app/gitops/bootstrap/root-app.yaml (lines 29-34) points ArgoCD at https://github.com/liav/Leumi-project.git and pipeline/gitops/applications; the mono-repo lives at liav-hasson/Leumi-project and the manifests are under quiz-app/gitops/applications. Bootstrapping ArgoCD with this manifest will fail immediately.
Terraform creates a circular dependency: quiz-app/iac/terraform/main.tf (lines 25-63) feeds module.prod_cluster a certificate ARN from module.route53, while quiz-app/iac/terraform/modules/route53/main.tf (lines 86-128) expects ALB data emitted by module.prod_cluster. Terraform cannot resolve this cycle, so terraform apply will not converge without refactoring.
High Severity

quiz-app/gitops/quiz-app/values.yaml (lines 33-55) hard-codes target group ARNs and security group IDs. Environment drift or re-provisioning will break deployments; these should come from inputs or ExternalSecrets.
quiz-app/Jenkinsfile (line 54) expands credentials directly into an HTTP URL. Jenkins masks logs, but storing ${user}:${password}@… invites accidental credential disclosure and requires escaping for any special characters.
quiz-app/iac/terraform references real AWS resource identifiers (e.g., public_zone_id, targetGroupARN, account ID 610964304971). Committing live IDs ties the code to a single account and risks unintended modifications.
Medium/Low Issues

quiz-app/Jenkinsfile (line 67) relies on BUILD_TIMESTAMP, which is not guaranteed unless a plugin is installed; on a stock controller this sets BUILD_TAG to null.
Cosign verification stage (quiz-app/Jenkinsfile (lines 217-246)) exits 0 even when verification fails, so supply-chain issues are silently ignored.
quiz-app/gitops and Terraform modules include WAF/ALB/Route53 configuration with production-only domains; consider parameterizing for dev/stage reuse.
